 *
 * ## Project Overview
 *
 * This file contains the key source code for my personal portfolio website, a fully
 * functional Spring Boot web application that I developed and deployed myself. The
 * goal of this project was twofold: first, to deepen my understanding of the
 * end-to-end process of standing up a modern web application, and second, to create a
 * professional space to showcase my skills and experience.
 *
 * This project is a direct reflection of my ability to take a project from concept to
 * a live, deployed state, which aligns with Everlaw's emphasis on end-to-end feature
 * ownership.
 *
 * ## Technologies & Architecture
 *
 * - **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot (Web, Tomcat)
 * - **Frontend:** JSP (JavaServer Pages), CSS, HTML
 * - **Build & Dependency Management:** Apache Maven
 *
 * The application follows a classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Spring Boot's
 * embedded Tomcat server handles web requests, which are routed by a `HomeController`
 * to render the appropriate JSP view (`home.jsp`). This demonstrates a clean
 * separation of concerns between handling web traffic and presenting the UI.
